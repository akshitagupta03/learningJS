Javascript timing events

the window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals
these time intervals are called timing events

two key methods are:

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
// executes a function after waiting a specified number of ms

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
// same as setTimeout() but repeats the execution of function continuously
